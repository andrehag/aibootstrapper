# About
This is an attempt to use GPT to bootstrap a project. As an alternative to a preconfigured project create, it tries to let GPT make the decions and set up the starting project based on a brief description.

#What to do
- Clone the repository
- `yarn`
- `yarn build`
- Run `dist/index.js` from an *empty* folder.

It doesnt' have any overwrite-protection or path-argument yet, so if you run it in a folder with contents, your risk it being overwritten.

This is an experiment and it's pretty rough around the edges.
